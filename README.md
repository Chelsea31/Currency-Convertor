# Currency-Convertor
Currency Convertor is a GUI based Python App which provides the user with the current currency conversion rates by requesting the data from a Currency Conversion API `(CurrencyLayer)`. The Data recieved is in the form of JSON and is then parsed according to the User Input in the App and then Conversions are done and Displayed.
